## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Sky blue (#87CEEB) to evoke clarity and openness.
- Background color: Very light gray (#F0F0F0), creating a clean, non-distracting surface for content.
- Accent color: Soft lavender (#E6E6FA) for interactive elements and highlights.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque sans-serif known for its modern, neutral appearance; good for UI and readability.
- Use simple, clear icons from a set like Font Awesome Free or Material Icons.
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout to present information in an organized, easy-to-scan manner.
- Subtle transitions on status updates and job submissions to provide user feedback without being distracting.
